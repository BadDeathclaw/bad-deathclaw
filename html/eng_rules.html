<h2>Rules:</h2><br>
A. Ignorance is not a excuse, read the rules.

0. The server is relaxed and conflict is permitted. Robbery and combat is expected to happen and be recurrent. 
You will die, frequently, sometimes without expecting it or even having the possibility of avoiding it. Events will often be out of your control. Sometimes you just can't do anything no matter how good you are. Remember, losing is !FUN!
    0.1 Know your faction lore and specific rules. If you play as any aligned faction, Legion, NCR or Brotherhood of Steel, you will be treated according to the faction rules, no matter if you know them or not.

1. Don't be a dick. Play for fun, not to win.
Going out of your way to seriously negatively impact or end the round for someone with little IC justification is against the rules. 
Don't overstep your boundaries and motivations, which includes command roles. 
You aren't god, you clicked a button, if you abuse it, it'll be treated as a Rule 1 break.

2. Do not use information gained outside of in character means.
Example, metagaming. This refers to things like Discord, Teamspeak, and Skype.
Character Relationships may persist between rounds, but should not be used for any advantage, and any prior information is not kept. 
This includes things like the location of faction bases, such as the BoS Bunker, or Vault. 
Chasing or metagrudging people for one of your past deaths with other character is metagaming.

3. Do not say in character (IC) things in the out of character (OOC) chat channel.
Do not describe the current round’s events in the OOC channel.
Do not say OOC things in any IC channel.
LOOC is an exception, but should be limited to relevant information, and assisting other players.

4. The role you spawn in as is the role you should play, whether an NCR Ranger, or a lowly Raider. You are expected not to ghost or leave shortly after roundstart if you didn’t get the role you like. Notify staff if you need to leave at round-start, and we’ll reopen the job slot and remove you.

5. In-game administration rulings are final. 

Incidences of admin abuse, negligence or disputed rulings can be taken to the discord.
If an Admin says an issue is resolved, they are not obligated to tell you of anything further. Deliberately lying or misrepresenting facts in adminhelps will be dealt with harshly, and likely with a ban.
6. Faction Metagaming. Do not rush another faction’s base; for example the Legion rushing the NCR’s base at the start of the round, or vice versa. Faction Base attacks should not occur before at least 30 minutes into a round.
Claiming to have stumbled across faction bases is also discouraged, as it’s a poor excuse to know where it is.
6B. Approach, Motivation and Escalation

1. Do not attack someone wordlessly. 
At the start of round, NCR and Legion are considered to have general information of the others presence, but no precise locations. 
At no point is KOS permitted between Legion and NCR, and should always involve a demand of surrender, or an announcement they’re about to be killed.
All other positions are expected to have reasoning and roleplay their intentions clearly well before escalation.

2. Establish hostility before attacking.
Approaches are necessary and the other needs to be aware of you before any escalation. A response or acknowledgement is required, whether them running away or drawing their gun.
Shouting "i'll shoot you haha" and proceeding to instantly gun someone down isn't a approach, let alone escalation. This includes as a raider or wastelander, let yourself be known, speak first, wait for a response, if you get shot wordless in return they are violating the rules and you ahelp it, say_log's are easily checkable.
[7:48 AM] RenGusta ~ 自閉症: 3. Escalation comes with reasoning and is mostly limited by role background.
An NCR trooper isn't a Raider to rob, assault or enslave people, and isn't allowed rulewise to be your meme rapist maniac. Same goes for Wastelanders, Legionaries and so on.
    3.1 The following factions and positions are given motivation and reasoning for;
Raiders: Robbery by threat or murder, kidnapping, rape, slavery, desertion (into Wastelander), whatever your sick mind can come up with.
NCR Recruits/Troopers: desertion (into Wastelander).
NCR, whole faction: arresting troopers or NCR civvies for going against the faction laws or objectives.

Legion, whole faction: Enslaving other players for manual work or forced conversion. 
Legion cannot desert under penalty of death. 
If you desert you become valid to the entire Legion.
BoS, whole faction: Robbery by threat or murder to acquire high end tech or directly required supplies, arresting faction members for going against the faction laws or objectives.
    3.2 Motivations doesn't make you free from the approach rules, they just give you a reason for escalation.

4. Do not be unnecessarily hostile. Arguments are fine, being an asshole for no reason isn't.
This includes salt in OOC and DSAY. It’s okay to be upset over the round not going the way you wanted it to, but it’s important to remember that losing is !FUN! Unnecessary levels of salt will be dealt with by muting. Hostility, abuse, trolling and flaming will earn a ban.

5. Fleeing confrontation constitutes escalation.
If a raider hails you and you decide to flee he can chase and attack you. Same applies for the NCR and Legion to each other, to flee and avoid conflict is to recognize the threat and flee from confrontation over it.

C. General Conflict

If a player wrongs you (theft, breaks into your shop, etc), you may retaliate in any way you see fit. Who dies, who kills and who started it is meaningless to the rules, as long as the approach rules are followed.
You can rob, be robbed, defend yourself, murder or be murdered, as long as approach is followed it will be valid. 

You may instigate conflict with another player within reasoning and motivation. You can't rob and rape a random victim while unprovoked as a Wastelander or Settler, but you could as a Raider. Stay true to your chosen position and mindset, and always remember to escalate appropriately.

C.1. NCR and Legion Conflict

1. Given that approach rules are followed combat is allowed at any point;
And is expected to be initiated, the NCR and Legion are at war. 
To engage with your enemy at every point isn't required but its expected and encouraged. However fleeing is a valid point and alternative for any reason, that you feel like you can't win that fight, that you were only scouting, for being too wounded, any reason you see fit is a reason to flee from a fight even as a soldier. Escalation rules apply.

KoS and approach rules still apply

D. Alignment and Siding

1. Natural Wastelanders (those who spawn as so or resign as a raider or civilian) are allowed to join and side with any of the factions.
NCR or Legion deserters, forced or not, aren't allowed to side with any faction for the rest of their character life, and are considered equivalent to Wastelanders.

2. No hostile action is allowed to be taken while siding with a faction unless you are in their full uniform and attire. Unless someone looking at you can clearly see which side you’re on, you’re required to stay out of combat. If you wish to enter combat, escalation is required, such as saying, “For the Legion!” “For the NCR!” and so on.
E. Uniforms and Armor

1. Faction uniforms are to be kept at all times unless deserting or infiltrating non-lethally.
(Expect consequences if you desert your respective faction!)
Uniforms include badge, clothes, gloves, shoes and mask if any is provided.

2. Faction armor can be changed out for other items, but should not prevent identification. This applies especially to Legion, who lack IDs and hsve distinctive armor.

3. Faction uniforms can be used by anyone, but fall under these rules, and require full escalation, regardless of initial faction.You are also under the requirements of full escalation, no infiltrators going “Fuck you, NCR!” and blasting them.

4. If dressed as a member of a faction, you are treated as one for matters of escalation and conflict.

F. Caesar’s Legion Specific Rules

0. No female legionnaires.

1. Stay within the Roman theme, your name is required to stick with the theme.
In lore it is a common and frequent practice to rename even the forced recruitees into more fitting names.

2. No medicine save for healing powder, poultice and mushrooms. Chems must be disposed of.

3. Legionnaires don't and can't keep any kind of advanced technology that your average tribal could not maintain. This does not prohibit them from capturing or working with third parties to compensate.

4. Legion ranks are defined directly by equipment. And like so promotions happen to the highest ranking member left after their superior died as long as the equipment can be recovered, follow whoever has the biggest fanciest hat and armor. They should also remain in uniform, unless actively infiltrating. It's not bad gear.

5. Legionnaires do not accept Ghoul members, Ghouls are considered cursed by Mars and should be executed.

6. Caesar’s Legion consider women inferior, this delegates them to support and slavery, rarely if ever do they accept a woman as worthy as more than a slave.

7. NCR must be strung up on a cross when captured, as are chem users.

8. Men are to be trained as Legionaries, while women are to be trained as healers and farmers, as well as cooks.

9. Caesar's Legion is comprised of mainly tribals, meaning most of them do not know how to read, however the Centurions of war camps are typically somewhat educated.

G. NCR Specific Rules

0. The chain of command goes as;
Colonel
Major
Captain
Lieutenant
Sergeant
Trooper
Recruit

The NCR Rangers operate almost entirely outside of the normal NCR army. 
They do not follow normal military ranks. 
Rangers are working alongside the local forces, and should co-operate wherever possible. 
This means listening to the requests and complying to the orders provided by the NCR Officers.
Ranger Detachment and its Ranks;
Veteran Ranger
Patrol Ranger
Scout Ranger
Ranger Recruit

1. Rule 2 of section J applies heavily to the NCR names, no other naming restrictions are given.

2. Breaking the Chain of Command or deserting means you can be summarily executed by commanding officers.

3. Rangers, Lieutenant, Captain, and Sergeant MUST follow the NCR code of conduct
No Drugs, excluding med-x in the absence of other medicine.
No drinking, gambling or fucking on the job.

4. Rangers are beholden to their orders, the CO's, and common sense.
The Scout Ranger, Patrol Ranger and Veteran Rangers don't answer to anyone but their superiors  and the CO's (Captain and Lieutenant). SGT's are still allowed to rule over the base in case of a ranger fucking around or looting the armoury.

5. NCR should never cut deals with raiders and the such.

6. The Sergeant is in-charge of Requisitions unless the anyone with a higher rank says otherwise. Rangers and Troops should not barge into the armory and loot it. Roleplay as a proper soldier.

7. Prisoners should not be subject to torture or any harm when arrested. The Captain or highest rank may order an execution of the prisoner if they have committed a major crime such as murder or rape etcetera.

H. The Brotherhood of Steel Rules

0. This is the West Coast Chapter/Brotherhood, the East Chapter should only make an appearance through events.

1.  The Brotherhood of Steel is held to a much higher standard than anything else on the server. As such as the rules are harder to follow, and the repercussions are more severe. 
They have an established Chain of Command, known as the Chain that Binds. 
This means orders to not supercede individuals along the chain, to prevent insubordination.
Paladin orders Knights or whoever is in charge of an initiate, to perform a task instead of ordering the initiate personally. 
Initiates should be assigned to a senior member when possible.

2. The Brotherhood of Steel values advanced technology, and advanced technology only. Massive, terrifying threats to human existence, or the Brotherhood’s existence, are an exception, but that is really just about it. They are rarely interested in anything short of power armor or huge supplies of energy weapons.

3. The Brotherhood of Steel is an isolationist faction, and as such only trades for, well, technology, as well as vital resources to their survival.

3a. The Brotherhood would never trade their own technology, unless it is vital to their immediate survival or meant that they could obtain technology they couldn’t otherwise.

4. The Brotherhood of Steel very rarely takes on new recruits, typically those who have proven themselves to the Brotherhood through some extraordinary manner, like crawling into an irradiated pre-war military base and not dying.

5. They do not fiddle around with genetic tampering, diseases, and viruses. They may research it (i.e monkey), but not expose players to it or even release it to the public.

I. The Vault Rules

0. The vault has no knowledge of the outside world, including if it is safe or not to open their doors which must stay closed.

1. The way they act, depends on the Overseer and his directives.

2. The Wasteland is a big scary place for the Vault Dwellers, so expect to roleplay as a character completely scared of the Wasteland and biased to the Vault as years of /Vault propaganda/ and listen to the Overseer. Dwellers shouldn’t rebel, unless if something/certain someone (i.e Overseer and his decisions) threatens their precious lives.

3. Officers are supposed to keep the Dwellers safe, and only neutralize those that pose an actual threat. Those who don’t and are convicted of minor crimes, are to head to the Brig to serve time. 

4. Leaving the Vault is not allowed unless you have absolutely no other option.

Notes:
The vault may have an experiment chosen for it by the overseer, anything that is potentially rulebreaking should be brought to active staff to prevent needless repercussions.
Vault experiments may also be provided by Staff, at their leisure.

J. Lowpop, Continuity and Cloning.

1. Do not loot faction bases if there are no factions there to defend said base. As a rule of thumb faction bases are a excluded zone for looting at any rounds under 40 pop.

2. Don't name your character something obnoxious, nor do it over jokes.
Biggus Dickus, Marius Fuckos and so on won't be tolerated, but Raiders are free to have anything from phrases, emotion, and expressions, to things as mundane as “Abraxo Man”

3. Never spawn the same character twice.
If you die, do not attempt to resume your prior life.
You have no memory of what happened in your last characters life and you are a new person. 
If by accident you spawn the same character ahelp it, admins will return you to the lobby, and if you only realize it a few minutes into the round still ahelp it, if you get caught you get reprimanded.

4. When cloned, the time you were scanned is the point you remember from. You will not recall who killed you, or even current information.
When cloned via pod-people means, you are functionally a new person, having only the personality and traits of the person recreated, without their memory.
Roleplay Appropriately!

5. Do not kill braindeads. Looting is fair game, but don't kill them. Catatonics are dead already and anything can be done to them.
    4.1 Do not loot your fellow legionnaires or ncr soldiers, store their bodies at the Armoury(NCR), or the Fortress(legion) when you see one of your teammates go braindead.

K. Silicons

Cyborgs and robots are held to a higher degree and violations result in direct jobban or tempban.

0. Know and follow your laws by the letter.
No excuses given, you are given abnormal powers, trust and access, to break your laws is to eat a ban.

1. Eyebots are bound to their direct or indirect creator.
If they lack a creator they are meaningless and are allowed to roam the waste but not take part in it.
If they were created in a base, Vault, Enclave, NCR, and so on, they are bound to their faction and like so must care for and repair their compound and crew.

1.1 Bots aren't allowed to take part in fights.
Bots who are attacked can still defend themselves but aren't allowed to pick up anything but handguns and other one handed weapons.

1.2 Do not abuse bots mob immunity.
Bots who enter, fight on, clean or loot neutral zones and dungeons will be treated as a offense to A-R1. Bots immunity to mob aggro exists for a reason, if you abuse it you'll eat a ban, no notes beforehand.

2. Borgs are stuck to their law set unconditionally but follow any command structure that the laws apply to.
